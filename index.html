            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
                    My name is Amalia Rodriguez. I am an actress and performer, born and raised in Mexico City. 
                    For the last ten years I’ve been working not only as a performer but I have also been collaborating in different projects in the fields of arts, 
                    such as in production, director assistance, drama teacher and, more recently, 
                    in the creation of an artistic archive of Edward James. 
                    These works allowed me to travel to different places and work with people from different ages and cultural backgrounds.
                    Curiosity in digital arts dragged me into technologies. 
                    So in January 2019, I decided to enroll myself in a 6- month web-development boot-camp 
                    in order to broaden my professional career.

                    <p>
                        The title of the project, hidden dimension, has been taken from the 
                        Edward T. Hall essay under the same name “The Hidden Dimension". It is an “in-situ” sound installation project.
                        The development of this project leads to experience with language, story telling, observation, 
                        communication, and intimacy under the influence of our environment, in this particular case, the urban public spaces that surround us.
                        The main idea is to record personal stories, stories about the places etc. and create QR codes for each of them. 
                        These will then be placed at the corresponding spots in the city, 
                        like a “graffiti sound” which anyone who pass by can “read” with his own telephone device. 
                        The spots and their stories will be connected to form a suggested route through the city.
